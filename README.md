## CANCER DIAGNOSIS USING GENE EXPRESSION 

The objective of this project is to predict what type ofcancerapatienthasusing gene expression of an RNA-seq and machine learning and create a basic web application for it. The common cancers that was trained in for this project were Breast Cancer, Kidney Renal clear cell Carcinoma, Colon Adenocarcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma and Prostate Adenocarcinoma. The author will be using agene expression file that they have found in UCI Machine Learning Repository that contains the five cancers. They will need to feature select the genes and standardize the datasets using a Standardization method such as min max or standard standardization in Python. Three algorithms will be used for this project, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbour and Deep Neural Networks. The author will find the mean between the three algorithms and will show the user the finalresultthroughthewebapplicationthatwillbedeveloped using Flask.The author will need to split the datasetto80% totrainand20% to test and produce an acceptable model. They will be using supervised learning for machine learning. The author chose this for her Final Year Project because they are both interested in Machine Learning and Biology.
